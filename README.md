The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can persist in a latent form as integrated DNA (provirus) in resting CD4+ T cells unaffected by antiretroviral therapy. Despite being a major obstacle for eradication efforts, it remains unclear which infected cells survive, persist, and ultimately enter the long-lived reservoir. Here, we determine the genetic divergence and integration times of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope sequences collected from infected macaques. We show that the proviral divergence as well as phylogenetically estimated integration times display a biphasic decline over time. Investigating the dynamics of the mutational distributions, we show that SIV genomes in short-lived cells are on average more diverged, while long-lived cells contain less diverged virus. The change in the mutational distributions over time explain the observed biphasic decline in divergence of the proviruses. This suggests that long-lived cells harbor virus deposited earlier in infection, while short-lived cells predominantly harbor more recent virus.
